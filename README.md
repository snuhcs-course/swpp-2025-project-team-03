VoiceTutor is an AI-powered learning application that helps students strengthen their understanding by **speaking out loud**.  
Through conversational review sessions, adaptive quizzes, and multimodal analysis (ASR, prosody, and reasoning), the app evaluates not just answers but **conceptual understanding**.  
It is designed for elementary or middle school students, teachers, and parents who want deeper insight into learning progress beyond traditional test scores.

## Features

- **Conversational Review**: Short, AI-guided verbal review sessions with open-ended questions.
- **Adaptive Quizzes**: Automatically generated follow-up questions tailored to each studentâ€™s weak points.
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Evaluation of content accuracy, reasoning structure, and supportive delivery metrics (speech rate, pauses, intonation).
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual summaries of concept mastery and learning trends over time.
