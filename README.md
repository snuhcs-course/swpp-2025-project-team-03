# VoiceTutor

VoiceTutor is an AI-powered learning application that helps students strengthen their understanding by **speaking out loud**.  
Through conversational review sessions, adaptive quizzes, and multimodal analysis (ASR, prosody, and reasoning), the app evaluates not just answers but **conceptual understanding**.  
It is designed for students, teachers, and parents who want deeper insight into learning progress beyond traditional test scores.
